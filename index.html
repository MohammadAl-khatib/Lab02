<p>
    Hello, welcome to my website, I am Mohammad AlKhatib, a civil egineer,
    and software development student.
</p>
<p>
    I graduated from the university of Jordan, then worked for several local
    and international companies, met a lot of awsome people and made some core
    relations.
</p>
<p>
    My previous work included (but not limited to) design, drawing, supervision,
    quality control, and testing materials.
</p>
<h3 id = "programmer">A New Challenge</h3>
<p>
After a lot of thinking, I believed I have something to do better than site 
works in engineering, I am kind of a mental person who loves to think, solve
problems, read, and experience new stuff.
</p>
<p>
    Programming is an industry that grows so rapidly, makes you feel updated
    about what is going in the world, easy to find resources and contact 
    professinals.
</p>
<p>
    One of the major causes I chose programming that it will help you manage
    your day and life.
    you can have time for your hobbies, exercise, and it is a promising career
    when we consider its income.
</p>
<p>
    I hope at the end of my journey I will reach my goal, and I wish I
    find support from ASAC, friends, and family
